## üß≠ Project Overview

This project is a scheduling application tailored for studios (e.g., hair salons, tattoo shops) and their teams. It enables clients to book appointments with individual employees or the entire studio. Key features include:

- Customizable service durations (e.g., 30, 60, 90 minutes)
- Configurable buffer times between appointments
- Limits on daily appointments per studio and per employee
- Support for multiple employees with individual schedules
- Support for days closed or blocks to not be available on specific times
- Client-facing booking interface with service and time slot selection

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with Mantine components
- **Backend**: Next js serverless functions with Prisma ORM
- **Database**: An sql database but prisma takes care of the syntax
- **Authentication**: Custom made
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema Considerations

- Consider our schema [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) and mention if we need to make changes to it.

## üßë‚Äçüíº Admin Panel Pages

- **Dashboard**: Overview of appointments, employee availability, and key metrics.
- **Studio Settings**: Configure studio details, operating hours, and booking policies.
- **Team Management**: Add/edit employees, set individual schedules, availability toggle, and assign services.
- **Services Management**: Create and manage service offerings.
- **Booking Rules**: Define global rules like buffer times and appointment limits.
- **Notifications**: Set up email/SMS reminders and confirmations.
- **Calendar View**: Visual representation of bookings and availability.

## üìÖ Client Booking Flow

1. **Service Selection**: Clients choose a service from available offerings.
2. **Employee Selection** (optional): Option to select a specific employee or 'Any Available'.
3. **Date & Time Selection**: Interactive calendar displaying available slots.
4. **Client Information**: Form to collect client details and preferences.
5. **Confirmation**: Summary of booking details with confirmation message.
6. **Post-Booking**: Option to add appointment to personal calendar and receive notifications.

## üé® UX Considerations

- Use Mantine components for a consistent and responsive UI.
- Implement real-time availability checks to prevent double bookings.
- Provide clear feedback and validation throughout the booking process.
- Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness across all pages.

## üß† AI Guidance

When generating code or providing suggestions:

- Follow the outlined admin and client workflows.
- Utilize Mantine UI components for frontend development.
- Maintain consistency with the project's architecture and design principles.
